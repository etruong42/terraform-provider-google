The Terraform Google provider is a plugin that allows [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) to manage resources on Google Cloud Platform. This provider is maintained by the [Terraform team at Google](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/partnering-on-open-source-Google-and-HashiCorp-engineers-on-managing-GCP-infrastructure.html) and the Terraform team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)

The ['google-beta' provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta) contains preview features and features at a beta [launch stage](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Refer to the [provider versions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html) documentation for more information about how to use `google-beta`.

Quick Starts
----------------------

- [Getting Started with the Google Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
- [Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs)

Upgrading the provider
----------------------

The Google provider doesn't upgrade automatically once you've started using it. After a new release you can run

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

to upgrade to the latest stable version of the Google provider. See the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions)
for more information on provider upgrades, and how to set version constraints on your provider.

Building the provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp
$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
$ make build
```
